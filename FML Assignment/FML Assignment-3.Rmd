#Answer:
  
# The answer to question 2 was 0.1096654, and the answer to question 5 was 0.1087106, which is nearly identical.The sole difference between the exact approach and the naÃ¯ve bayes method is that the exact method requires the same independent variable categorization as the naive bayes method to predict. We can check that the answer to question 2 is more accurate because we used the exact data from the pivot table.

#Question no 7



nb.model <- naiveBayes(Personal.Loan~ Online + CreditCard, data = train.df)
To_Predict=data.frame(Online=1, CreditCard= 1)
predict(nb.model, To_Predict,type = 'raw')

# The answer to question 7 is 0.08463445, and the answer to job 5 is 0.1087106.
# The outcome is nearly identical to that of Task5.
# Because of the rounding, there is just a minor change.
# The discrepancy has no effect on the output's rank order.
